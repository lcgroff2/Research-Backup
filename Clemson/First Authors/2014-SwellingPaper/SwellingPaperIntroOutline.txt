Primary objectives:

Explore the effect of solvent induced swelling on the photophysics of CPNs
	- PLQY
	- Quenching Efficiency
	- Lifetime
	- multiple energy transfer rates
Why?
	- Identifying the limiting factors that affect exciton transport in 	  CPs
	- Providing rough estimate of number of quenching species
	- Test hypothesis that MET is faster in CPNs vs. polymer in sol'n, and           implications for device applications.
How?
	- Spectral Analysis and PLQY
	- TCSPC
	- FAD
	- Lattice Model
