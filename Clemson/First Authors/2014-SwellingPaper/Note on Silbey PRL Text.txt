So, I did some digging as to where exactly the exponents of 2-4 for the (dx_0/dx_s)^k come from, and the values don't represent something quite as simple as 3D vs. 2D vs. 1D transport. According to an article by H. Kuhn in J. Chem Phys from 1970, looking beyond two interacting point dipoles whose distance dependence is R^-6 from Förster, a point dipole interacting with a 2D sheet of dipoles has a distance dependence of R^-4, and if it's a point diople interacting with a 3D block of dipoles, then it becomes R^-3. A more recent (04-06?) in Adv Mater mentions the R^-4 dependence for point-dipole-to-sheet-dipole interactions, and that there's a R^-2 dependence between two sheets of dipoles. I'm assuming that k=3 shouldn't be drastically different from k=2 or k=4, since for our lattice model, we could view it as any of those pictures.
